This notebook focuses on learning the pandas library. It explores some data from a netflix datasets to:

    1. Convert the .csv to a pandas DataFrame
    2. Check the unique values, missing values, find duplicate counts and statistical values eg mean, std for the dataset
    3. Grouping the rows
    4. Plotting some intereseting charts
    5. Creating new columns based on categories
    6. Using conditionals to filter rows

The libraries used include: (I recommend creating a virtual environment and installing them. Use `pip install library_name`)

    1. Pandas
    2. Numpy
    3. Matplotlib
    4. Plotly
    5. Seaborn
    6. Jupyter Lab - for running the notebook


While exploring the notebook, I tried answering the following questions:

    1. What's the distribution between TV Shows and Movies in Netflix?
    2. Which are the top 10 countries that have their content in Netflix?
    3. How are the rating distributions in the data?
    4. Who are the top 10 directors with content in the netflix data?
    5. Which contents are there that are based on the sports categories and aren't documentaries?
